\begin{itembox}[l]{Explanation of new study in our manuscript}
%   this paper highlights the contribution.

In a previous paper that was authored for a conference \cite{kuzuno22iwsec},
this study proposed an additional kernel security mechanism design,
implementations, and evaluation results.  The clear differences between this
paper and the previous paper are identified and listed below \cite{kuzuno22iwsec}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item First, this paper aims to clearly establish the approach of
  kernel memory protection approach. It discusses the kernel data and hardware
  security control requirement from the viewpoint of actual implementations
  to obtain a more technical detail on the discussion.

  \item Second, this paper investigated the kernel vulnerabilities statistics,
  types, and four Proof-of-Code (PoC) programs to evaluate the 
  KDPM (kernel data protection mechanism) security capability.
  % supports other OSes (e.g., FreeBSD and XNU kernel) and architectures
  % (e.g., ARM and RISC-V) 

% vulnerable kernel code and protected kernel data.

\item Additionally, this paper discusses the feasibility of implementing of KDPM
  that relies on the instruction increase of KDPM for latest Linux kernel.

\end{itemize}
  
%This shows that KPRM is one of the countermeasures against kernel
%vulnerability attacks.

\end{itembox}

We have appreciated the Editor-in-Chief's review again. We fully revised
figures, sentences, and evaluations that are the explanation of design,
implementation, feasibility, and comparison from previous researches.
%\cite{kuzuno21iwsec}.

%% \section{New study in our manuscript}
%% We have inserted the sentence of explanation to the following sections
%% and revised our manuscript from the previous paper
%% \cite{kuzuno21iwsec}. To denote the changes to our manuscript, these
%% are indicated by using: N-01 to N-11 (N is a new study) with red
%% highlighted for the review process. In addition, The figures and not
%% highlighted sentences are also rewritten for this submission.

%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item {\bf [N-01]:} Abstract. It is fully revised, we have highlighted the research problem, additional proposed mechanism, and latest evaluation.
%% \item {\bf [N-02]:} Introduction. We have rewritten the introduction that indicates the research problem, the characteristics of the proposed mechanism , and evaluation results.
%% \item {\bf [N-03]:} Memory corruption and Countermeasures. We have investigated the Proof-of-Concept  (PoC) code of kernel vulnerabilities to occur kernel memory corruption for the privilege escalation.
%% \item {\bf [N-04]:} Threat Model. We have revised the threat model to explain the environment of the adversary and the condition of the proposed mechanism.
%% \item {\bf [N-05]:} The design of MKM. Due to a lack of cleary explanation in previous paper \cite{kuzuno21iwsec}.  The highlighted places with sentences are revised for the explanation of the research requirement and solution. Additionally, we have redesigned the proposed mechanism's behavior to reduce the processing steps for the kernel component.
%% \item {\bf [N-06]:} MKM Implementation. This section contains actual information with new figures.
%% \item {\bf [N-07]:} Case study. In the attack case, we have written the detail of flow for the proposed mechanism that mitigates the kernel memory corruption at the kernel layer.
%% \item {\bf [N-08]:} Evaluation. We have evaluated the feasibility of the proposed method has low overhead for the user's environment.
%% \item {\bf [N-09]:} Discussion. Due to a lack of discussion. We have calculated the actual cost of kernel observation mechanism \cite{kuzuno21ispec} is low overhead for the evaluation. Additionally, for the portability of the proposed mechanism, we have investigated the applying process at the source code level of other OSes.  Moreover, we have considered the benefit of hardware requirements to help the implementation of the proposed mechanism.
%% \item {\bf [N-10]:} Related Works We have surveyed the related work and the comparison with existing works again. It indicates the detail of our contribution in the system security field that is a lack in the previous paper \cite{kuzuno21iwsec}.
%% \item {\bf [N-11]:} Conclusion. It is also fully revised. We have summarized the research problem, proposed mechanism, and evaluation.
%% \end{itemize}

%% We have thankful for your review again. We have summarized the main
%% reason for this submission. The revising process and additional
%% contents indicate the new study (e.g.,
%% %
%% abstract and all sections are revised, 5 figures are rewritten, 3
%% figures are new, and 2 tables are new).
%% %
%% We carefully revised the whole of the paper is to contain new
%% contributions for the research community.
%% %
%% The denoted places are part of the main difference point between our
%% manuscript and the previous paper \cite{kuzuno21iwsec}.
